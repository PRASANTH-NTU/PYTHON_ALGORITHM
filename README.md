# ALGORITHM IN PYTHON

This repository contains the sample code to run and visualise different algorithm.

The code is platform independent [tested in Windows, Mac and Linux]


### Prerequisites

This code was developed and tested in Python 3.6


### Installing

Apart from having Python3, matplotlib package have to be installed

For Windows/ Mac/ Linux users,
	  Open the command prompt and type  

```
python3 get-pip.py
pip install matplotlib
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the code

As of now, there's one code in the repository. 
As time goes by, more and more sample code will be added.

[1_sorting_algo_diff_kinds_with_animation](https://github.com/PRASANTH-NTU/PYTHON_ALGORITHM/blob/master/1_sorting_algo_diff_kinds_with_animation.py) - This program sorts the randoly generated data into using different sorting algorithm such as monkey sort, bubble sort, selection sort and merge sort.
